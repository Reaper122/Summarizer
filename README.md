# Summarizer
Building a summarizer involves several components that work together to create a robust and effective text summarization tool. Here, we will break down the role of each component you mentioned:

1. **Summarize Component**:
2. **Summary Fine Tuner Component**:

### 1. Summarize Component

**Purpose**: The `Summarize` component is responsible for performing the actual summarization of input text using a pre-trained model. This component can work with models that are already fine-tuned for summarization tasks.

#### Steps Involved:

1. **Load Pre-trained Model**: Use a pre-trained model such as `facebook/bart-large-cnn` from the Hugging Face model hub. These models are already trained on large datasets for summarization tasks.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenize the input text using the tokenizer associated with the pre-trained model.
3. **Generate Summary**: Use the model to generate a summary based on the tokenized input text.
4. **Post-processing**: Decode the generated tokens into human-readable text.

### 2. Summary Fine Tuner Component

**Purpose**: The `Summary Fine Tuner` component is used to fine-tune a pre-trained model on a specific dataset to improve its performance for a particular domain or use case. Fine-tuning helps the model adapt to the specific characteristics and nuances of the target data.

#### Steps Involved:

1. **Prepare Dataset**: Gather and preprocess the dataset that you will use for fine-tuning. This dataset should contain pairs of texts and their corresponding summaries.
2. **Load Pre-trained Model**: Load a pre-trained model that you want to fine-tune.
3. **Fine-tuning**: Train the model on the prepared dataset. This step involves updating the model's weights based on the new data.
4. **Save Fine-tuned Model**: Save the fine-tuned model for later use.

### How They Work Together

1. **Summarize Component**:
    - Provides immediate summarization capabilities using an existing pre-trained model.
    - Suitable for general summarization tasks where the pre-trained model's performance is acceptable.

2. **Summary Fine Tuner Component**:
    - Allows customization and improvement of the summarization model for specific datasets and use cases.
    - Enhances the summarizer's accuracy and relevance by adapting it to domain-specific language and structures.

### Building a Summarizer

To build a comprehensive summarizer, you would typically:

1. **Start with a Pre-trained Model**: Use the `Summarize` component to test and evaluate the performance of pre-trained models on your target texts.
2. **Collect and Prepare Data**: Gather a dataset that includes the types of texts and summaries you need for your application.
3. **Fine-tune the Model**: Use the `Summary Fine Tuner` component to fine-tune the pre-trained model on your dataset.
4. **Deploy the Summarizer**: Once fine-tuned, use the updated model in the `Summarize` component for more accurate and relevant summaries.

By combining these components, you can create a summarizer that leverages powerful pre-trained models and adapts them to your specific needs, ensuring high-quality and relevant summaries.
